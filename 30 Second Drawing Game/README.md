# 30 Second Drawing Game

This is a simple web-based version of the "30 Second Drawing" game.

## How to play
1. A word or name shown to draw. (Example: Icecream, Iron Man)
2. A automatic timer for Time Range in second( default: 30 seconds) start on Go button click.
3. On “Go” all the players must draw a picture of the word in 30 seconds. Everyone has to keep drawing until the 30 seconds is up, and stop drawing when the 30 seconds is up.
4.  When the time’s up, everyone compares drawings and votes on which drawing is the best. (It doesn’t have to be the most realistic, it can be the cutest, funniest, or whatever the players like.)  Whoever wins gets one point.  If there is a tie, each winner gets a point.
5. The first player to get a most number of points, wins!

- **HTML Structure**:
  - A basic HTML structure with an audio player (`<audio>`), file input for uploading audio, number inputs for setting the time range, and buttons for starting, stopping, and resetting the game.
  
- **CSS**:
  - Basic styles to center the game interface, style the buttons, inputs, and create a visually pleasing layout with shadows and padding.

- **JavaScript**:
  - Handles the logic for starting, stopping, and resetting the game. It uses `setTimeout` to stop the audio after a random time between the min and max time. It also handles input validation to ensure the time range is valid and the audio file is selected.
