# Dynamic Drag and Drop with Autosave

This is a web-based application that allows users to dynamically create editable divs and custom containers, all with drag-and-drop functionality. The application also includes an autosave feature that saves the state of the elements to **localStorage**, ensuring that users' changes persist even after refreshing or reopening the page.

## Requirements

- A modern web browser that supports HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript.
- No external dependencies are required.

## How to Use

### 1. **Create a Custom Container**
- Click the **Create Custom Container** button on the sidebar to add a new custom container to the main area. The container can hold multiple editable divs and can be resized.

### 2. **Add Editable Divs**
- Click the **Add Editable Div** button to add a new editable div inside the first custom container. The div is initially populated with default text ("Edit me!").
- The div is **content-editable**, so users can directly edit the text within the div.

### 3. **Drag-and-Drop**
- You can drag the editable divs within the container. The divs can be moved around, and the layout will be saved.

### 4. **Resize Divs**
- Both the custom containers and editable divs are resizable. Simply drag the bottom-right corner to adjust the size.

### 5. **Delete Editable Divs**
- Each editable div has a delete button (red icon in the top-right corner). Clicking the button will remove the div from the container.

### 6. **Delete All Divs**
- The **Delete All** button on the sidebar allows you to delete all editable divs and custom containers. A confirmation prompt will appear before deletion.

### 7. **Autosave**
- All changes, such as text edits, resizing, and movements, are automatically saved in the browser's **localStorage**. When you reload the page, the layout and content of the containers and divs will be restored.

### 8. **Toggle Sidebar**
- The sidebar can be collapsed or expanded by clicking the toggle button. The sidebar will shrink to a minimal width, showing just icons, when collapsed.
